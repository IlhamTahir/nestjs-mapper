- **commit-msg**: Check commit message format (follows conventional commits)

## üìù Commit Message Convention

The project uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Type Descriptions

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation update
- `style`: Code formatting (no functional changes)
- `refactor`: Refactoring
- `perf`: Performance optimization
- `test`: Test-related
- `chore`: Build process or auxiliary tool changes
- `ci`: CI configuration files and script changes
- `build`: Build system or external dependency changes
- `revert`: Revert commit

### Examples

```bash
feat: add abstract class support
fix: fix empty method body detection logic
docs: update README documentation
chore: add release scripts
```

## üîÑ Version Management

The project uses [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) for version management:

- Automatically generate version numbers
- Automatically generate CHANGELOG.md
- Automatically create git tags
- Support pre-release versions

## üì¶ Package Publishing

### Publishing to npm

Make sure you are logged in to npm:

```bash
npm login
```

Packages will be published to:

- `@ilhamtahir/ts-mapper` - Core mapping library
- `@ilhamtahir/nest-mapper` - NestJS integration

### Publishing Permissions

Only project maintainers can publish packages. If you need publishing permissions, please contact the project owner.

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Publishing failed: Insufficient permissions**

   ```bash
   npm login
   # Make sure you have publishing permissions
   ```

2. **Version conflict**

   ```bash
   # Check if there are new commits on remote
   git pull origin main
   ```

3. **Build failure**

   ```bash
   # Clean and reinstall dependencies
   pnpm clean
   pnpm install
   pnpm build
   ```

4. **Git hooks failure**
   ```bash
   # Fix code style issues
   pnpm run lint
   pnpm run format
   ```

### Rolling Back Release

If you need to roll back a release:

```bash
# Unpublish from npm (within 24 hours)
npm unpublish @ilhamtahir/ts-mapper@<version>
npm unpublish @ilhamtahir/nest-mapper@<version>

# Delete git tag
git tag -d v<version>
git push origin :refs/tags/v<version>

# Revert commit
git revert <commit-hash>
```
